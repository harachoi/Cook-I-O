## About This Project
Since COVID-19, a lot of families and groups choose to make food for themselves rather than going out to eat.<br /> 
There are a lot of recipes out there but there are some special recipes that only the cook knows.<br /> 
This app helps people share their own recipes and also communicate their everyday life. Like Instagram, <br />
it has a feature that a user can follow another user. Also,  a user can block another user.<br /> 
There is also a feature of direct messaging to people who the user follows.
